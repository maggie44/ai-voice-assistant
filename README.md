# A WIP AI voice assistant running on a Raspberry Pi

An AI voice assistant.

```
User: 'Hey X...'
Device: 'Yes?'
User: 'Tell me about...'
Device: 'Answer...'
```

Response is generated by AI, providing a far greater range of potential answers and detail.

## TODO:

- Add ability to cancel while running
- Allow voice commands to allow sending the output to different sources
